Description:
This project presents a prototype for an automated way of mapping conference names found in researcher profiles with their corresponding entry in the UCD OBRSS system.
The repository is divided into numbered folders for each step of the process.
Each folder contains the scripts and resources needed to perform that step.
The scripts are numbered in the order they should be executed.
Before running a script ensure that the working directory is configured correctly in Spyder.
E.g. if running "5-1-modelTraining-logisticRegression.py", ensure that the working directory is "\5-modelTraining". Otherwise an error will be thrown.
